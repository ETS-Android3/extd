31/12/2021 01:11:37 ------------------ USEFUL INFORMATION ------------------
31/12/2021 01:11:37 X DAMAGE available on display, using it for polling hints.
31/12/2021 01:11:37   To disable this behavior use: '-noxdamage'
31/12/2021 01:11:37 
31/12/2021 01:11:37   Most compositing window managers like 'compiz' or 'beryl'
31/12/2021 01:11:37   cause X DAMAGE to fail, and so you may not see any screen
31/12/2021 01:11:37   updates via VNC.  Either disable 'compiz' (recommended) or
31/12/2021 01:11:37   supply the x11vnc '-noxdamage' command line option.
31/12/2021 01:11:37 X COMPOSITE available on display, using it for window polling.
31/12/2021 01:11:37   To disable this behavior use: '-noxcomposite'
31/12/2021 01:11:37 
31/12/2021 01:11:37 Wireframing: -wireframe mode is in effect for window moves.
31/12/2021 01:11:37   If this yields undesired behavior (poor response, painting
31/12/2021 01:11:37   errors, etc) it may be disabled:
31/12/2021 01:11:37    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
31/12/2021 01:11:37    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
31/12/2021 01:11:37      moved window is released in the new position.
31/12/2021 01:11:37   Also see the -help entry for tuning parameters.
31/12/2021 01:11:37   You can press 3 Alt_L's (Left "Alt" key) in a row to 
31/12/2021 01:11:37   repaint the screen, also see the -fixscreen option for
31/12/2021 01:11:37   periodic repaints.
31/12/2021 01:11:37 
31/12/2021 01:11:37 XFIXES available on display, resetting cursor mode
31/12/2021 01:11:37   to: '-cursor most'.
31/12/2021 01:11:37   to disable this behavior use: '-cursor arrow'
31/12/2021 01:11:37   or '-noxfixes'.
31/12/2021 01:11:37 using XFIXES for cursor drawing.
31/12/2021 01:11:37 GrabServer control via XTEST.
31/12/2021 01:11:37 
31/12/2021 01:11:37 Scroll Detection: -scrollcopyrect mode is in effect to
31/12/2021 01:11:37   use RECORD extension to try to detect scrolling windows
31/12/2021 01:11:37   (induced by either user keystroke or mouse input).
31/12/2021 01:11:37   If this yields undesired behavior (poor response, painting
31/12/2021 01:11:37   errors, etc) it may be disabled via: '-noscr'
31/12/2021 01:11:37   Also see the -help entry for tuning parameters.
31/12/2021 01:11:37   You can press 3 Alt_L's (Left "Alt" key) in a row to 
31/12/2021 01:11:37   repaint the screen, also see the -fixscreen option for
31/12/2021 01:11:37   periodic repaints.
31/12/2021 01:11:37 
31/12/2021 01:11:37 XKEYBOARD: number of keysyms per keycode 10 is greater
31/12/2021 01:11:37   than 4 and 213 keysyms are mapped above 4.
31/12/2021 01:11:37   Automatically switching to -xkb mode.
31/12/2021 01:11:37   If this makes the key mapping worse you can
31/12/2021 01:11:37   disable it with the "-noxkb" option.
31/12/2021 01:11:37   Also, remember "-remap DEAD" for accenting characters.

******************************************************************************
Have you tried the x11vnc '-ncache' VNC client-side pixel caching feature yet?

The scheme stores pixel data offscreen on the VNC viewer side for faster
retrieval.  It should work with any VNC viewer.  Try it by running:

    x11vnc -ncache 10 ...

One can also add -ncache_cr for smooth 'copyrect' window motion.
