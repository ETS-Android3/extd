25/11/2021 16:31:20   Most compositing window managers like 'compiz' or 'beryl'
25/11/2021 16:31:20   cause X DAMAGE to fail, and so you may not see any screen
25/11/2021 16:31:20   updates via VNC.  Either disable 'compiz' (recommended) or
25/11/2021 16:31:20   supply the x11vnc '-noxdamage' command line option.
25/11/2021 16:31:20 X COMPOSITE available on display, using it for window polling.
25/11/2021 16:31:20   To disable this behavior use: '-noxcomposite'

25/11/2021 16:31:20 Wireframing: -wireframe mode is in effect for window moves.
25/11/2021 16:31:20   If this yields undesired behavior (poor response, painting
25/11/2021 16:31:20   errors, etc) it may be disabled:
25/11/2021 16:31:20    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
25/11/2021 16:31:20    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
25/11/2021 16:31:20      moved window is released in the new position.
25/11/2021 16:31:20   Also see the -help entry for tuning parameters.
25/11/2021 16:31:20   You can press 3 Alt_L's (Left "Alt" key) in a row to 
25/11/2021 16:31:20   repaint the screen, also see the -fixscreen option for
25/11/2021 16:31:20   periodic repaints.

25/11/2021 16:31:20 Scroll Detection: -scrollcopyrect mode is in effect to
25/11/2021 16:31:20   use RECORD extension to try to detect scrolling windows
25/11/2021 16:31:20   (induced by either user keystroke or mouse input).
25/11/2021 16:31:20   If this yields undesired behavior (poor response, painting
25/11/2021 16:31:20   errors, etc) it may be disabled via: '-noscr'
25/11/2021 16:31:20   Also see the -help entry for tuning parameters.
25/11/2021 16:31:20   You can press 3 Alt_L's (Left "Alt" key) in a row to

25/11/2021 16:31:20 XKEYBOARD: number of keysyms per keycode 7 is greater
25/11/2021 16:31:20   than 4 and 195 keysyms are mapped above 4.
25/11/2021 16:31:20   Automatically switching to -xkb mode.
25/11/2021 16:31:20   If this makes the key mapping worse you can
25/11/2021 16:31:20   disable it with the "-noxkb" option.
25/11/2021 16:31:20   Also, remember "-remap DEAD" for accenting characters.

******************************************************************************
Have you tried the x11vnc '-ncache' VNC client-side pixel caching feature yet?

The scheme stores pixel data offscreen on the VNC viewer side for faster
retrieval.  It should work with any VNC viewer.  Try it by running:

    x11vnc -ncache 10 ...

One can also add -ncache_cr for smooth 'copyrect' window motion.
